# Traffic Signs Recognition
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

This is the second Project due for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, following several modules on  Neyral Networks and Deep Learning.

The objective for it is to design, train and test a Neural Network capable of analyzing images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) and otaining a level of accuracy higher than 93%.


To complete the project, two files are submitted and part of this Git repo: a file containing project [code](https://github.com/russom/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project-RussoM/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier-Michelangelo_Russo.ipynb) in the form of a Jupyther Python notebook and an annotated [writeup](https://github.com/russom/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project-RussoM/blob/master/writeup.md) describing the fundamental aspects and limitations of the solution implemented.

The output of the Notebook run is also provided as an [HTML file](https://github.com/russom/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project-RussoM/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier-Michelangelo_Russo.html), to avoiding the re-training of the network.
